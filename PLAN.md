# Future Parser Development Plan

This document outlines potential new parsers that could enhance the project management and personal information management capabilities of the system.

## Project Management Parsers

### Resource Management

- **Budget Parser**
  - Parse budget allocations and financial constraints
  - Patterns: "budget of $X", "allocated $X", "within $X budget"
  - Example: "Project has a budget of $50,000 for Q1"

- **Resource Allocation Parser**
  - Track resource assignments and availability
  - Patterns: "needs X people", "requires X hours/days", "allocate X resources"
  - Example: "Task needs 2 developers for 3 days"

- **Capacity Parser**
  - Parse workload and capacity information
  - Patterns: "at X% capacity", "X hours available", "X slots open"
  - Example: "Team is at 80% capacity for next sprint"

### Timeline Management

- **Milestone Parser**
  - Identify project milestones and key dates
  - Patterns: "milestone: X", "key delivery: X", "phase completion: X"
  - Example: "Milestone: Beta Release by Q2"

- **Sprint Parser**
  - Parse sprint-related information
  - Patterns: "sprint X", "in sprint X", "for sprint X"
  - Example: "Task planned for Sprint 3"

- **Deadline Risk Parser**
  - Analyze deadline risk indicators
  - Patterns: "at risk", "likely to slip", "tight deadline"
  - Example: "Deadline at risk due to dependencies"

### Quality Management

- **Quality Metric Parser**
  - Parse quality requirements and metrics
  - Patterns: "must meet X standard", "quality target: X", "acceptance criteria: X"
  - Example: "Must meet 99.9% uptime requirement"

- **Testing Coverage Parser**
  - Parse test coverage requirements
  - Patterns: "X% test coverage", "coverage target: X", "minimum coverage: X"
  - Example: "Requires 90% test coverage"

### Communication

- **Stakeholder Parser**
  - Identify stakeholder information and requirements
  - Patterns: "stakeholder: X", "X team requires", "X department needs"
  - Example: "Stakeholder: Marketing team requires demo by Friday"

- **Meeting Type Parser**
  - Categorize different types of meetings
  - Patterns: "standup", "retrospective", "planning session", "review"
  - Example: "Sprint retrospective meeting on Thursday"

## Personal Information Management Parsers

### Task Management

- **Energy Level Parser**
  - Parse task energy requirements
  - Patterns: "high energy", "low focus", "deep work"
  - Example: "Task requires high focus morning session"

- **Task Dependency Parser**
  - Parse complex task dependencies
  - Patterns: "blocked by", "depends on", "after completing"
  - Example: "Blocked by API documentation review"

### Time Management

- **Time Block Parser**
  - Parse time blocking information
  - Patterns: "deep work: X-Y", "focus time: X", "blocked for X"
  - Example: "Deep work block: 9AM-11AM"

- **Time Estimate Parser**
  - Parse time estimates with confidence levels
  - Patterns: "roughly X hours", "approximately X days", "between X-Y hours"
  - Example: "Task will take roughly 3-4 hours"

### Knowledge Management

- **Reference Parser**
  - Parse document and reference information
  - Patterns: "ref: X", "see document: X", "in spec: X"
  - Example: "See document: API-SPEC-2023"

- **Decision Parser**
  - Parse decision points and rationales
  - Patterns: "decided to X because Y", "choice: X", "selected X over Y"
  - Example: "Decided to use React because of team expertise"

### Personal Development

- **Skill Parser**
  - Parse skill requirements and learning objectives
  - Patterns: "requires X skill", "need to learn X", "skill gap: X"
  - Example: "Requires TypeScript knowledge"

- **Learning Parser**
  - Parse learning and development information
  - Patterns: "learn X", "study Y", "practice Z"
  - Example: "Study GraphQL documentation"

## Integration Opportunities

These new parsers could be integrated with:

- Project management tools (Jira, Trello, etc.)
- Calendar systems
- Time tracking software
- Documentation systems
- Knowledge bases

## Implementation Priority

1. High Priority (Next Release):
   - Milestone Parser
   - Sprint Parser
   - Time Block Parser
   - Decision Parser

2. Medium Priority:
   - Resource Allocation Parser
   - Capacity Parser
   - Energy Level Parser
   - Skill Parser

3. Future Consideration:
   - Quality Metric Parser
   - Testing Coverage Parser
   - Reference Parser
   - Learning Parser

## Notes

- All new parsers should follow the existing confidence scoring system
- Each parser should include comprehensive test coverage
- Consider adding pattern learning capabilities for improved accuracy
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing parser ecosystem
