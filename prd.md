# Perfect Text Parser System PRD

Version: 1.0.0
Last Updated: 2024-01-02

## Overview

### Problem Statement

The current parser system effectively extracts information from text using a collection of specialized parsers. However, it doesn't improve the text itself. Users need a system that can take informal, inconsistent text input and transform it into well-formatted, standardized text while maintaining the original meaning.

### Goals

- Transform informal text into standardized, professional format
- Maintain accurate meaning during transformation
- Provide transparent tracking of all changes
- Ensure consistent output formatting
- Retain current system's modularity and simplicity
- Maintain pure JavaScript/ES Modules architecture

### Non-Goals

#### Architectural Non-Goals

- **TypeScript Integration**: The project explicitly rejects TypeScript and other type systems to maintain:
  - Zero build complexity
  - Direct JavaScript execution
  - Simple maintenance model
  - Clear debugging paths
  - No transpilation requirements

#### Functional Non-Goals

- Creating new content or adding information not implied in original text
- Changing meaning or intent of original text
- Supporting multiple languages (English-only for initial version)
- Real-time processing of streaming text

#### Technical Non-Goals

- Adding any build steps or compilation processes
- Introducing additional toolchain requirements
- Adding development environment complexities
- Creating indirect code relationships through tooling

## Technical Architecture

### Core Principles

#### Explicit Avoidance of TypeScript

This project explicitly avoids TypeScript to:

- Reduce build complexity
- Simplify maintenance
- Minimize toolchain requirements
- Avoid compilation steps
- Maintain pure JavaScript clarity

Quality is instead assured through:

- Comprehensive documentation
- Thorough testing
- Clear code organization
- Rigorous review processes

#### Module System

- Use ES Modules exclusively
- Require explicit .js extensions for all imports/exports
- Maintain direct module relationships
- Avoid transpilation or build steps

#### Code Organization

- Keep code structure flat and clear
- Use meaningful file and folder names
- Maintain logical module grouping
- Document all interfaces thoroughly

### Module System Requirements

#### ES Modules Implementation

This project requires strict ES Module usage with these specific rules:

- All imports/exports MUST use explicit .js extensions
- No CommonJS (require) syntax allowed
- No dynamic imports except where specifically approved

#### Module Structure Requirements

Each module must follow strict export/import patterns and maintain clear separation of concerns. Implementation examples are provided in the README.md file.

#### Directory Organization

The project must maintain a clear directory structure that separates parsers, utilities, and core services. Implementation details are provided in the README.md file.

#### Import/Export Rules

1. Every parser module must export:
   - name (string constant)
   - perfect function (async)
   - any helper functions needed by other modules

2. Utility modules must:
   - Use named exports
   - Include explicit file extensions
   - Export only necessary functions

3. Main index.js must:
   - Re-export necessary parser interfaces
   - Maintain flat export structure
   - Avoid circular dependencies

### Processing Pipeline Requirements

The system must implement a staged processing pipeline that:

1. Processes text through distinct stages in a specific order
2. Allows parsers to be grouped by functionality
3. Prevents parser conflicts through clear stage boundaries
4. Maintains high performance through efficient stage processing
5. Supports excluding specific parsers via configuration
6. Tracks performance metrics per stage
7. Provides detailed change tracking for each stage
8. Handles parser failures gracefully without affecting other stages

The specific stages and parsers are documented in the README.md file.

### Parser Requirements

Each parser in the system must:

1. Implement the standard parser interface (documented in README.md)
2. Handle its own validation and error recovery
3. Provide confidence levels for all corrections
4. Track position information for changes
5. Maintain original meaning of text
6. Be independent and not rely on other parsers
7. Follow consistent naming and formatting rules
8. Include comprehensive test coverage

### API Requirements

The system must provide a REST API that:

1. Accepts text input in a standard format
2. Supports configuration options for parser exclusion
3. Returns detailed results including:
   - Original and perfected text
   - Stage-by-stage processing information
   - Performance metrics
   - Confidence levels
   - Error details when applicable
4. Handles errors gracefully with clear error messages
5. Follows REST best practices
6. Provides proper content type headers
7. Implements appropriate status codes

Implementation examples are provided in the README.md file.
